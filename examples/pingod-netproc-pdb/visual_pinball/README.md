## Template Table assets
---

Table assets created and exported using Inkscape. Edit and export each layer by hiding other layers.

- Wood
- Blueprints (exported from VP)
- Playfield (Artwork)
- Inserts
- Decals

### Inkscape export
---

Just export to `png` replacing the existing image depending on the layer. Make sure export is set to Page with will export the whole page.

### Visual Pinball Import
---

These `pngs` are assigned to `Decals` inside the layer `Decals_Lamp`.

To replace with your `.png` edits, open the `ImageManager` using `F3`. The images in here are named `decals_inserts` and `decals_lamps` you can replace these. First changes you can `Reimport From`, but any changes after that you can just `Reimport`.
