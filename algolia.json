[{"content":" What is it?  PinGod is for creating pinball game logic with graphics display window.\nA pinball machine or a simulator can trigger the game and vice versa.\nWhy that name?  The Godot game engine was used so it\u0026amp;rsquo;s Pinball + Godot = PinGod.\nPinGo or PinGodot? We know who the penguin is and PinGodot doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t ring well. This isn\u0026amp;rsquo;t a holy framework but you can makes games faster like a Pin God so we can rest the case on that decision.\nIs it difficult to learn and use?  Not really. Godot doesn\u0026amp;rsquo;t have a steep learning curve and you don\u0026amp;rsquo;t need to know everything to be able to finish a game or make scenes.\nThere are full examples in the src with basic to advanced scripted games which will give you an idea of C# sripting tasks and how things were done.\nYou should be able to lean back on PinGod doing the machine work for you while you compose scenes and do some simple C# scripting.\nAdvantages?   Framework base that covers standard pinball machine features used across games C# scripting (or GScript) Easy to make 2D, 3D graphics scenes Collaborating with others on Scenes / Scripts Localization Recording/Playback of games saves much time in testing  More to be added when comes to mind..\nClass Reference Documentation Class References - Script Documentation\n","date":1666193175,"description":"Documentation for PinGod games","lastmod":"2022-10-26T15:26:15Z","objectID":"3976528693a0108357f4928017600865","permalink":"https://FlippingFlips.github.io/pingod-addons/","publishdate":"2022-11-23T15:26:15Z","title":"Home"},{"content":"Pinball game framework\n","date":1672012800,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-12-26T00:00:00Z","objectID":"6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47","permalink":"https://FlippingFlips.github.io/pingod-addons/about/","publishdate":"2022-12-26T00:00:00Z","title":"About PinGod"},{"content":"Helper class for audio.\n SfxAssets VoiceAssets MusicAssets  Class Reference note: if you want the finished signal on audio to work when the file is an ogg, the loop must be unchecked then reimported from the import tab\n_EnterTree  Initializes the AudioStreamPlayers.

You can do this with Alt + PrtScn. Open Microsoft Paint and paste in you screenshot of the editor. Get there with windows key and typing paint Select the outer playfield and crop it in MsPaint Click resize by pixels, uncheck Maintain aspect ratio and set to 400 x 900 Save this image into your game folder so Godot picks it up and you can assign this to window image. res://assets/img is a good place to put it.  Create custom Window   Filter the Files to show playfield, you should see PlayfieldWindow and playfield_control Duplicate the playfield_control.tscn and name like playfield_control_mygamename.tscn Duplicate the PlayfieldWindow.tscn and name like PlayfieldWindowMyGame.tscn Now right click the duplicated files and move to res://autoload. Could be anywhere, but easy to put here and find. Open your PlayfieldWindowMyGame.tscn and set the Scene under WindowPinGod in the inspector to your playfield_control_mygamename.tscn In your custom res://Machine.tscn change the Switch Window to your new window. You can load the game but the playfield is missing. Add a texture to playfield_control_mygamename.tscn in the PlayfieldTextureRect The texture size should be 400x900 but you can adjust the control and window if you need larger or smaller.  New Buttons  Open the Machine.tscn in a text editor so you can see your switches you\u0026amp;rsquo;ve added to reference and copy names.\nNow you can just duplicate a button and rename it to the switch name. Select a button and use Ctrl+D and move it into position.\nSome buttons are set not to toggle so they send on/off switch. Like slingshots and spinners are never held down.\n","date":1672068375,"description":"","lastmod":"2022-10-26T15:26:15Z","objectID":"a2ecc4aae76820e99d855330df399c47","permalink":"https://FlippingFlips.github.io/pingod-addons/tips-guides/playfield-switch-window/","publishdate":"2022-12-26T15:26:15Z","title":"Creating custom playfield switch window"},{"content":" Filter Godot files by ScoreEntry Duplicate the ScoreEntry.tscn and move to your res://autoload directory Add the packed scene location, replacing any existing in the res:autoload/Resources.tscn Add the new scene into the Game.tscn so it knows where your version is Edit away without effecting the addons and script.
