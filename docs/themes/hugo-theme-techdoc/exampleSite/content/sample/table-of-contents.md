The `TableOfContents` field with `true` in your contentâ€™s front matter will render a table of contents.

```
TableOfContents: true
```

Setting the built-in .TableOfContents variables can configure what heading levels you want to include in TOC. See [the built-in .TableOfContents variables settings](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/#table-of-contents)
