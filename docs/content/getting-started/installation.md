### Download Godot editor
---

* Download the editor at https://godotengine.org/
* Godot is portable (no installation required) (Version 3.4 C# MONO)
* It's up to you where you extract the files to but for simplicity sake `C:\Godot\`

You should rename the Godot executable to `godot.exe`. The shortcuts will use this and it's easy to remember.

After you've added to environment then you can just run `godot` from the environment.
