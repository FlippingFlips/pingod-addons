### Download Godot editor
---

* Download the editor at https://godotengine.org/
* Godot is portable (no installation required) (Version 3.4 C# MONO)
* It's up to you where you extract the files to but for simplicity sake `C:\Godot\`

You should rename the Godot executable to `godot.exe`. The shortcuts will use this and it's easy to remember.

After you've added to environment then you can just run `godot` from the environment.

### Dotnet SDK

If you already have a `dotnet sdk` then you can skip this step.

- Install x64:

[sdk-6.0.307-windows-x64-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.307-windows-x64-installer)

- or x86:

[sdk-6.0.307-windows-x86-installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-6.0.307-windows-x86-installer)

### Git
---

Use Git to pull the repositories from Github, you don't need a Github account just the software to do this.

Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.
Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash).
```
