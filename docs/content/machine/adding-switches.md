The following are the default switches in the `BasicGameGodot\PinGodGame.tscn` file.

When created in the Godot interface, they are saved in this scene file.

You can add your switches here.

```
_switches = {
"coin": 2,
"down": 5,
"enter": 7,
"exit": 4,
"flipper_l": 11,
"flipper_r": 9,
"inlane_l": 22,
"inlane_r": 23,
"mball_saucer": 27,
"outlane_l": 21,
"outlane_r": 24,
"plunger_lane": 20,
"slam_tilt": 16,
"sling_l": 25,
"sling_r": 26,
"start": 19,
"tilt": 17,
"trough_1": 81,
"trough_2": 82,
"trough_3": 83,
"trough_4": 84,
"up": 6
}
```

It can be faster than the Godot inspector and adding, especially when your switch collection builds up. Names must be unique.

This is all you need to do to add a switch.
