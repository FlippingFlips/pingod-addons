The following are the default switches in the `BasicGameGodot\PinGodGame.tscn` file.

When created in the Godot interface, they are saved in this scene file.

You can add your switches here.

```
_switches = {
"coin": 2,
"down": 5,
"enter": 7,
"exit": 4,
"flipperLwL": 11,
"flipperLwR": 9,
"inlaneL": 22,
"inlaneR": 23,
"mballSaucer": 27,
"outlaneL": 21,
"outlaneR": 24,
"plungerLane": 20,
"slamTilt": 16,
"slingL": 25,
"slingR": 26,
"start": 19,
"tilt": 17,
"trough0": 81,
"trough1": 82,
"trough2": 83,
"trough3": 84,
"up": 6
}
```

It can be faster than the Godot inspector and adding, especially when your switch collection builds up. Names must be unique.

This is all you need to do to add a switch.
